## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling masterpiece that delves deep into the
dark recesses of the human mind. The Overlook Hotel serves as a sinister stage
for the unfolding drama, with its sinister history seeping into every page. King
expertly crafts a slow-burning tension that steadily builds towards a heart-
pounding finale. Jack Torrance's descent into madness is both fascinating and
horrifying to witness, while his son Danny's psychic abilities add an extra
layer of unease to the narrative. The novel's exploration of family dynamics,
addiction, and the nature of evil make it a thought-provoking read that lingers
long after the final page. 'The Shining' is a must-read for horror enthusiasts
looking for a spine-tingling, psychologically rich tale.
