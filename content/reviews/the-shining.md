## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a masterclass in psychological horror, immersing
readers in a world where the line between reality and madness blurs. The tension
is palpable from the first page, building to a crescendo of dread that will
leave you on edge. King's characters are richly drawn, particularly Jack
Torrance, whose descent into darkness is both captivating and terrifying. While
the slow pacing may not appeal to all readers, it serves to deepen the sense of
isolation and mounting unease. The hotel itself becomes a character, its
malevolent presence seeping into every corner. 'The Shining' is a haunting and
unforgettable read that will linger with you long after the final page.
