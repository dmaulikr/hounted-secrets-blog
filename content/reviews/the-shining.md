Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a haunting masterpiece that delves deep into the
psychological horrors of isolation and the unraveling of the human mind. King's
meticulous attention to detail creates a palpable sense of dread that lingers
long after the final page. The characters, particularly Jack Torrance, are
