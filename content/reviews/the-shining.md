## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling tale that masterfully blends
psychological horror with supernatural elements. The eerie atmosphere of the
Overlook Hotel seeps through the pages, creating a sense of foreboding that
keeps the reader on edge. King's characterization is impeccable, particularly in
his portrayal of Jack's descent into madness and Danny's vulnerability. The slow
burn of the narrative allows the tension to build gradually, culminating in a
terrifying climax that will leave readers haunted long after they finish the
book. While some may find the pacing a bit sluggish at times, the payoff is well
worth it for those who appreciate a slow-burn horror story. Overall, 'The
Shining' remains a classic in the horror genre, showcasing King's talent for
weaving intricate and unsettling tales.
