## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling tale of isolation, madness, and the
supernatural. King's masterful writing immerses readers in the eerie atmosphere
of the Overlook Hotel, building tension with every page. The characters,
especially Jack Torrance, are deeply flawed and compelling, adding layers of
complexity to the psychological horror unfolding within the snow-covered walls.
While the pacing may drag for some, the slow burn serves to heighten the sense
of dread and impending doom. King's exploration of themes such as addiction,
family dynamics, and the nature of evil adds depth to the narrative, making 'The
Shining' a truly haunting read that lingers long after the final page is turned.
A must-read for horror fans seeking a classic that still delivers a spine-
tingling experience.
