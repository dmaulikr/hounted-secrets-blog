Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a masterclass in psychological horror, blending
supernatural elements with the raw, emotional struggles of its characters. The
tension is palpable from the very beginning, as the ominous setting of the
Overlook Hotel looms large over the Torrance family. King's meticulous attention
to detail creates a sense of unease that lingers long after the final page. Jack
Torrance's descent into madness is both tragic and terrifying, paralleled by
Wendy's desperate attempts to protect her son from the horrors unfolding around
them. 'The Shining' is a haunting exploration of family dynamics, addiction, and
the darkness that lies within us all. A must-read for horror fans who enjoy a
slow-burn, atmospheric thriller that will leave them questioning what is real
and what is imagined.
