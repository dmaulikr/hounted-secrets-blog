## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a winter-cabin masterpiece that delves deep into
the darkness of the human psyche. The eerie setting of the Overlook Hotel serves
as a character in itself, adding layers of suspense and foreboding to the
narrative. King's skillful characterization, particularly in depicting the
unraveling of Jack Torrance's mind, is both compelling and unsettling. The
interactions between the Torrance family members are fraught with tension,
mirroring the sinister forces at play within the hotel. While some readers may
find the psychological themes disturbing, the slow-burn pacing only heightens
the sense of impending horror. 'The Shining' is a gripping tale of isolation,
madness, and the supernatural, making it a must-read for fans of psychological
horror.
