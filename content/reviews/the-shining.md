## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a haunting and immersive exploration of
psychological terror. The slow burn of tension and eerie atmosphere grips the
reader from the first page, leading to a crescendo of fear and unease. King's
intricate character development, especially of the troubled Torrance family,
adds layers of complexity to the narrative, making their descent into madness
all the more chilling. The Overlook Hotel itself becomes a character, exuding a
malevolent presence that seeps into every corner of the story. While the pacing
may drag for some readers, the payoff is a gripping and unforgettable journey
into the darkest recesses of the human mind. 'The Shining' is a classic horror
novel that continues to terrify and captivate readers with its timeless tale of
isolation, madness, and supernatural forces.
