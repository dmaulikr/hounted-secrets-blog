## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling masterpiece in the horror genre that
delves deep into themes of isolation, madness, and the supernatural. The
atmospheric setting of the Overlook Hotel creates a sense of dread that lingers
long after the final page. King's character development is exceptional,
especially in his portrayal of Jack Torrance's descent into darkness. The
interactions between the characters, particularly Jack and his son Danny, are
filled with tension and unease. While the pacing may be slow for some readers,
the payoff is well worth it as the story builds to a heart-pounding climax. 'The
Shining' is a haunting and unforgettable tale that cements Stephen King's
reputation as a master of horror.
