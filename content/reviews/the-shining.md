## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling and atmospheric masterpiece that
delves deep into the darkness of the human psyche. The slow burn of the
narrative allows for a gradual immersion into the eerie world of the Overlook
Hotel, where every creak and whisper sends shivers down your spine. King's
ability to craft complex characters, particularly Jack Torrance, adds layers of
depth to the story, making it more than just a typical haunted house tale. While
the pacing may feel sluggish in parts, the payoff is worth it as the tension
builds to a terrifying crescendo. 'The Shining' is a psychological thriller that
will haunt you long after you turn the final page, cementing its status as a
horror classic.
