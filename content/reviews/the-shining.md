## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling masterpiece that delves deep into
themes of isolation, madness, and the supernatural. King's meticulous attention
to detail and expertly crafted characters make this psychological horror novel a
gripping and unsettling read. The tension builds steadily throughout, creating a
sense of dread that lingers long after the final page. Jack Torrance's descent
into madness is portrayed with harrowing realism, while Danny's psychic
abilities add an extra layer of unease to the narrative. However, the slow
pacing in certain sections may test some readers' patience, and the intense
scenes of horror could be too much for the faint of heart. Overall, 'The
Shining' is a haunting and unforgettable journey into the darkness of the human
psyche.
