## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling masterpiece that delves deep into the
psychological deterioration of its characters amidst a backdrop of supernatural
horror. King's atmospheric writing creates a sense of dread that lingers long
after the final page. The character of Jack Torrance is a fascinating study in
descent into madness, while his son Danny's psychic abilities add an intriguing
layer to the story. The Overlook Hotel itself becomes a character, with its dark
history and malevolent presence haunting every page. While the pacing may drag
at times, the slow build only serves to heighten the tension until the explosive
and terrifying climax. 'The Shining' is a must-read for horror fans looking for
a truly haunting experience.
