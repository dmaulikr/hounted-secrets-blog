## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling masterpiece that delves deep into the
darkness of the human psyche. The atmospheric setting of the Overlook Hotel
serves as a character in itself, creating a sense of foreboding and isolation
that seeps off the pages. King's exploration of addiction, family dynamics, and
the supernatural is expertly woven into a narrative that keeps readers on edge
throughout. The characters are flawed and complex, making their descent into
madness all the more terrifying to witness. While the pacing may be slow for
some, the payoff is well worth it as the tension builds to a heart-pounding
crescendo. 'The Shining' is a must-read for horror fans looking for a
psychological thrill ride that will haunt them long after the final page.
