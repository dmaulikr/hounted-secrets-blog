## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling masterpiece that delves deep into the
darkness of the human psyche. King's vivid descriptions and meticulous attention
to detail create a sense of foreboding that lingers long after the final page.
The characters are richly developed, with Jack Torrance's descent into madness
serving as a harrowing focal point. The Overlook Hotel itself becomes a
character, its sinister history and malevolent presence adding an extra layer of
unease. While the pacing may be slow for some readers, the payoff is well worth
it as the tension builds to a terrifying climax. 'The Shining' is a classic
horror novel that continues to haunt readers with its unforgettable blend of
psychological terror and supernatural dread.
