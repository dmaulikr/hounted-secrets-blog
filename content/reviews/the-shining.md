## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a haunting tale that grips you from the very
first page. The atmosphere is so palpable, you can almost feel the icy chill of
the Overlook Hotel seeping through the pages. King's characterization is
brilliant, particularly in his portrayal of Jack Torrance's gradual descent into
madness. The psychological tension is relentless, keeping you on edge as the
supernatural elements of the story unfold. While the pacing may drag in some
parts, the slow build only serves to heighten the suspense. 'The Shining' is a
masterclass in horror fiction, with its intricate plot and unforgettable imagery
leaving a lasting impression on readers long after the final page is turned.
