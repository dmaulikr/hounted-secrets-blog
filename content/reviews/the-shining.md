## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a masterclass in psychological horror, blending
supernatural elements with deeply human fears and vulnerabilities. The Overlook
Hotel becomes a character in its own right, oozing malevolence and driving the
tension to unbearable levels. King's exploration of the descent into madness is
both captivating and unsettling, as Jack Torrance's inner demons manifest in
terrifying ways. The dynamics within the Torrance family are fraught with
tension and unease, adding layers of complexity to the horror unfolding within
the hotel's walls. While the pacing may drag at times, the payoff is worth it as
the story builds to a crescendo of terror. 'The Shining' is a haunting and
unforgettable tale that cements Stephen King's legacy as a master of horror.
