## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a haunting and immersive horror novel that grips
you from the very first page. The slow burn of tension and the gradual
unraveling of the characters' sanity make for a truly unsettling reading
experience. King's atmospheric writing brings the Overlook Hotel to life in
vivid detail, creating a sense of foreboding that lingers long after you've
finished the book. The psychological depth of the characters, particularly
protagonist Jack Torrance, adds layers of complexity to the narrative, making
their descent into darkness all the more compelling. While the pacing may be
challenging for some readers, the payoff in terms of building suspense and
atmosphere is well worth it. 'The Shining' is a classic horror novel that
continues to terrify and captivate readers decades after its initial
publication.
