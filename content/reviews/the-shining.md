## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a haunting and atmospheric masterpiece that
delves deep into the psyche of its characters. The isolation of the snow-covered
hotel, coupled with the supernatural forces at play, creates a sense of dread
that lingers long after the final page. King's meticulous attention to detail
and character development makes the descent into madness feel all too real.
While the pacing may be slow for some, the payoff is well worth it as the
tension builds to a chilling climax. 'The Shining' is a must-read for horror
fans looking for a psychological thriller that will leave them questioning what
is real and what is imagined.
