## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a winter-cabin masterpiece that expertly blends
psychological terror with supernatural horror. The characters are vividly drawn,
with Jack Torrance's descent into madness and the eerie precognitive abilities
of his son Danny driving the narrative forward. King's atmospheric writing
creates a sense of unease that lingers long after the final page. While the
pacing may drag at times, the slow build only serves to heighten the tension,
leading to a climactic and chilling conclusion. 'The Shining' is a haunting
exploration of the darkness that can reside within the human mind and the
malevolent forces that can lurk in the shadows, making it a must-read for fans
of horror fiction.
