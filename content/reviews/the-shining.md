## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling masterpiece of psychological horror
that delves deep into the darkest corners of the human psyche. The isolated
setting of the Overlook Hotel, coupled with King's masterful storytelling,
creates an atmosphere of mounting dread that seeps into every page. Jack
Torrance's descent into madness is portrayed with such raw intensity that it's
both captivating and terrifying. King's exploration of themes like addiction,
family dynamics, and the power of evil make 'The Shining' a gripping and
thought-provoking read. While the slow pacing may deter some readers, the payoff
is a profoundly unsettling and unforgettable tale that will linger in your mind
long after you turn the final page.
