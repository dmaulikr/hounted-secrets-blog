## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling masterpiece of horror fiction that
delves deep into the psyche of its characters. King expertly weaves a tale of
isolation, supernatural forces, and the fragility of the human mind. The tension
steadily mounts as the characters' descent into madness becomes more pronounced,
creating a sense of unease that lingers long after the final page. Jack
Torrance's transformation is both fascinating and terrifying, and the Overlook
Hotel itself becomes a character shrouded in malevolence. While the pacing may
be slow for some readers, the atmospheric setting and psychological depth make
'The Shining' a must-read for fans of horror literature. Prepare to be haunted
by the ghosts of the Overlook Hotel long after you've finished the last chapter.
