## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling masterpiece that delves deep into the
darkness of the human psyche. The author expertly crafts a sense of foreboding
and unease that steadily escalates throughout the novel, keeping readers on the
edge of their seats. The characters, particularly Jack Torrance, are intricately
developed, making their descent into madness all the more haunting. King's
exploration of isolation, addiction, and the supernatural creates a rich
tapestry of horror that lingers long after the final page. While the pacing may
be a bit slow for some, the payoff is well worth it, as the tension reaches a
fever pitch in the heart-pounding conclusion. 'The Shining' is a must-read for
horror enthusiasts looking for a truly immersive and terrifying experience.
