## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling masterpiece that seamlessly blends
supernatural elements with psychological horror. The eerie atmosphere of the
Overlook Hotel seeps into every page, creating a sense of dread that builds
steadily throughout the story. King's characterization is superb, particularly
in his portrayal of Jack Torrance's descent into madness. The dynamics between
Jack, his wife Wendy, and their son Danny add layers of complexity to the
narrative, making it more than just a typical haunted house tale. While the
pacing may feel sluggish at times, each slow-burning moment serves to heighten
the tension and anticipation for the inevitable climax. 'The Shining' is a
haunting exploration of isolation, madness, and the terrifying power of the
human mind.
