## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a gripping horror novel that delves deep into
the psyche of its characters while creating a sense of creeping dread that
lingers long after the final page. King's ability to build tension through
atmospheric descriptions and psychological turmoil is unmatched, making this a
standout in the horror genre. The slow burn of the narrative allows readers to
immerse themselves in the eerie setting of the hotel, while the characters'
internal struggles add layers of complexity to the story. However, the intense
horror elements may be too much for some readers, and the pacing may test the
patience of those seeking quick thrills. Overall, 'The Shining' is a must-read
for horror enthusiasts looking for a deeply unsettling and memorable reading
experience.
