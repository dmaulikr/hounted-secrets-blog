## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a haunting masterpiece that lingers long after
the final page. King's skillful writing weaves a tale of psychological terror
and supernatural horror, drawing readers into the snowbound Overlook Hotel
alongside the Torrance family. The slow unraveling of Jack Torrance's sanity,
coupled with the eerie presence of the hotel's malevolent spirits, creates a
sense of dread that permeates every page. King's attention to detail and ability
to craft believable, flawed characters adds depth to the story, making the
horrors they face all the more impactful. While the pacing may be slow at times,
each moment serves to heighten the tension until the chilling climax. 'The
Shining' is a must-read for horror fans looking for a truly immersive and
unsettling experience.
