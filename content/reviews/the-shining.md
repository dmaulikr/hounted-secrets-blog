## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a winter-cabin horror masterpiece that
skillfully weaves psychological terror with supernatural elements. The slow-burn
tension keeps you on edge throughout, while King's vivid descriptions create a
chilling atmosphere that seeps into every page. Jack Torrance's descent into
madness is portrayed with unsettling realism, making him a truly terrifying
antagonist. However, it's the complexity of the characters, especially Jack's
son Danny and his paranormal abilities, that adds layers of depth to the story.
While the pacing may feel leisurely at times, it serves to heighten the suspense
and allows for a deeper exploration of the characters' inner turmoil. 'The
Shining' is a haunting and immersive read that will linger in your mind long
after you've turned the final page.
