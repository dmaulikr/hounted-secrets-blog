Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling masterpiece that delves into the
psychological breakdown of its characters in a setting that is both haunting and
immersive. The tension builds steadily throughout the story, creating a sense of
unease that lingers long after the final page. King's skillful writing draws
