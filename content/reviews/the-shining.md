Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a haunting tale that delves into the
psychological horrors of isolation and madness. King's skillful writing creates
a palpable sense of unease from the very beginning, drawing readers into the
eerie world of the Overlook Hotel. The characters, especially the troubled Jack
Torrance, are intricately developed, adding layers of complexity to the
