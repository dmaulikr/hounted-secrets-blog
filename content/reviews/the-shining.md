## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a masterclass in psychological horror, blending
supernatural elements with the complexities of human nature. The eerie setting
of the Overlook Hotel serves as a character in itself, enhancing the sense of
isolation and impending doom. King's vivid descriptions and meticulous character
development draw readers into the unraveling psyche of Jack Torrance, whose
descent into madness is both terrifying and tragically human. The bond between
Jack's son, Danny, and the enigmatic cook, Dick Hallorann, adds emotional depth
to the narrative, creating a sense of urgency as the supernatural forces at play
grow increasingly malevolent. 'The Shining' is a haunting exploration of
familial bonds, addiction, and the darkness that lurks within us all, making it
a must-read for fans of psychological horror.
