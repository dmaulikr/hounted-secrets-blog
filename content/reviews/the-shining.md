## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling masterpiece that dives deep into the
psyche of its characters, particularly Jack Torrance, whose descent into madness
is both captivating and terrifying. King's ability to build tension and create a
sense of foreboding is unparalleled, keeping readers on the edge of their seats
throughout the novel. The Overlook Hotel itself becomes a character, a
malevolent presence that looms over the story with a sense of impending doom.
While the pacing may lag at times, the payoff is worth it as the tension
escalates to a terrifying climax. 'The Shining' is a must-read for horror fans
looking for a psychological thriller that will haunt them long after the final
page.
