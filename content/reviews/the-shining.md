## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling and atmospheric masterpiece that
delves deep into the psychological horrors of isolation, addiction, and the
darkness that lurks within. King's ability to create a sense of dread and unease
is unparalleled, drawing readers into a world where the line between reality and
the supernatural blurs. The characters, especially Jack Torrance, are compelling
in their complexity, making their descent into madness all the more gripping.
While the pacing may lag at times, the slow burn only adds to the overall sense
of impending doom. 'The Shining' is a haunting tale that will linger in your
mind long after you turn the final page, solidifying its place as a classic in
the horror genre.
