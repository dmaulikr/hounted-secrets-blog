## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling masterpiece that delves into the
depths of human psyche and supernatural terror. King's writing is masterful,
creating a sense of dread and unease that lingers long after the final page. The
characters, particularly Jack Torrance, are intricately developed, making their
descent into madness all the more harrowing to witness. The Overlook Hotel
itself becomes a character, oozing malevolence and dread with its haunted
history and sinister presence. While the pacing may be slow for some, the
gradual build-up only serves to heighten the suspense and terror. 'The Shining'
is a must-read for horror fans looking for a psychological, atmospheric scare
that will haunt them long after they finish the book.
