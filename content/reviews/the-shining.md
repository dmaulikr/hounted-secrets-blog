Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling exploration of psychological horror
that delves deep into the darkness of the human mind. The eerie setting of the
Overlook Hotel serves as a perfect backdrop for the unfolding terror, with
King's masterful prose creating a palpable sense of dread that lingers long

haunting realism, making him a compelling yet deeply unsettling character. While

culminating in a heart-pounding climax that will leave readers breathless. 'The
Shining' is a must-read for horror enthusiasts looking for a truly spine-
