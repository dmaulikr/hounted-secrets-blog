## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling tale of isolation, haunted history,
and the unraveling of sanity. The oppressive atmosphere of the Overlook Hotel
seeps into every page, creating a sense of dread that builds steadily throughout
the novel. King's portrayal of Jack Torrance's mental deterioration is both
harrowing and captivating, making him a truly unforgettable character. Wendy and
Danny, Jack's wife and son, are equally well-drawn and sympathetic, adding
layers of emotional depth to the story. The blending of psychological horror and
supernatural elements creates a truly haunting reading experience that lingers
long after the final page. 'The Shining' is a must-read for horror fans looking
for a deeply unsettling and atmospheric tale of terror.
