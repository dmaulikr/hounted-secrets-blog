Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a haunting and atmospheric masterpiece that gets
under your skin from the very first page. King's descriptive prose brings the
eerie Overlook Hotel to life, casting a sense of foreboding over the entire

flawed and complex, making their descent into madness all the more chilling to
