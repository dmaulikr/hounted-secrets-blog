## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling tale that delves into the depths of
the human psyche. King's ability to create a sense of unease and tension is
unparalleled, making every creaking floorboard and shadow-filled corridor feel
menacing. The characters are richly developed, with their flaws and fears adding
layers of complexity to the narrative. However, the slow pacing in parts may
test the patience of some readers, and the graphic nature of certain scenes
could be disturbing for those with a more sensitive disposition. Overall, 'The
Shining' is a masterclass in horror storytelling, guaranteed to haunt readers
long after they've turned the final page.
