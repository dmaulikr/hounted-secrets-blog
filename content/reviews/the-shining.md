## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a chilling tale that delves deep into the
psychological horrors of isolation and the human mind. King's masterful
storytelling weaves a web of suspense and terror that grips the reader from the
very first page. The atmospheric setting of the snowbound Overlook Hotel adds to
the sense of claustrophobia and impending doom. The characters, particularly
Jack Torrance and his son Danny, are complex and deeply flawed, making their
descent into madness all the more harrowing to witness. While the pacing may be
slow for some, the gradual build-up of tension only serves to heighten the
final, terrifying climax. 'The Shining' is a classic horror novel that continues
to haunt readers long after they turn the final page.
