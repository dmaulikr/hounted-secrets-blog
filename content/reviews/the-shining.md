## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a masterclass in psychological horror, blending
supernatural elements with deeply human fears and flaws. The isolated setting of
the Overlook Hotel serves as a perfect backdrop for the escalating tension and
growing sense of dread. King's character development is exceptional,
particularly in the portrayal of Jack Torrance's gradual descent into madness.
Wendy and Danny, Jack's wife and son, are equally well-drawn and add emotional
depth to the story. The eerie atmosphere and unsettling events make 'The
Shining' a chilling and unforgettable read, with a conclusion that lingers long
after the final page. Fans of horror will delight in the psychological twists
and turns of this winter-cabin masterpiece.
