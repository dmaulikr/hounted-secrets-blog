## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a haunting tale that delves deep into the psyche
of its characters. The atmospheric tension that King creates is palpable, making
the Overlook Hotel feel like a character in itself. Jack Torrance's descent into
madness is a slow burn that keeps you on the edge of your seat, while his son
Danny's psychic abilities add an extra layer of unease. King's prose is
masterful, drawing readers into a world where the line between reality and the
supernatural blurs. While the pacing may be slow for some, the payoff is well
worth it as the story builds to a terrifying climax. 'The Shining' is a winter-
cabin masterpiece that will linger in your thoughts long after you've turned the
final page.
