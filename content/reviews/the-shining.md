## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a haunting tale that delves deep into the psyche
of its characters, especially Jack Torrance, whose descent into madness is both
tragic and terrifying to witness. The Overlook Hotel serves as a malevolent
backdrop, its corridors and rooms filled with a sense of dread that seeps into
every page. King's prose is gripping and evocative, painting a vivid picture of
isolation and impending doom. While the story unfolds slowly, each moment is
laden with tension and unease, building towards a climax that is both shocking
and inevitable. 'The Shining' is a classic in the horror genre, a chilling
exploration of fear, family, and the darkness that lurks within us all.
