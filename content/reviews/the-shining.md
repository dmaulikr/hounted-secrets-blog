## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a masterclass in psychological horror. The
isolated setting of the Overlook Hotel becomes a character in itself, casting a
sinister shadow over the unfolding events. King's writing is immersive and
intense, drawing readers into a world where reality blurs with supernatural
forces. The characters, especially Jack Torrance and his son Danny, are deeply
flawed and compelling, adding layers of complexity to the story. While the
pacing may feel slow initially, the tension steadily builds to a heart-pounding
climax. 'The Shining' is a chilling exploration of madness, familial bonds, and
the darkness that lurks within us all. A must-read for horror fans looking for a
truly haunting experience.
