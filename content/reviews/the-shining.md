## Full spoiler-free review
Stephen King's 'The Shining' is a winter-cabin masterpiece that delves deep into
the darkness of the human psyche. The Overlook Hotel serves as a character in
itself, with its eerie corridors and malevolent presence creating a suffocating
atmosphere of dread. King's exploration of Jack Torrance's gradual unraveling is
both compelling and terrifying, as we witness his descent into madness and the
toll it takes on his family. The psychic abilities of Danny add an intriguing
supernatural element to the story, adding layers of complexity to the narrative.
'The Shining' is a slow-burn horror that builds tension gradually, culminating
in a gripping and chilling climax that will leave readers haunted long after the
final page.
