## Full spoiler-free review
 'Ghost Light' is a chilling tale that blends elements of ghostly folklore with
the high-stakes drama of the theater world. The author masterfully creates a
sense of foreboding from the very first page, drawing readers into a world where
the line between reality and the supernatural blurs. The eerie atmosphere is
palpable, with the haunted theater setting serving as a character in its own
right. While the pacing may lag at times, the escalating sense of dread keeps
the reader engaged. The characters, though somewhat lacking in depth, each bring
their own fears and vulnerabilities to the story, adding layers to the unfolding
mystery. Overall, 'Ghost Light' is a haunting read that will leave you checking
over your shoulder long after you've turned the final page.
