## Full spoiler-free review
 'Ghost Light' delivers a chilling tale set in the shadowy world of a haunted
theater. The author excels at creating a palpable sense of dread and unease,
using vivid descriptions to bring the eerie setting to life. The pacing is
relentless, keeping readers on edge as they follow the characters through a
series of increasingly terrifying encounters with the supernatural. While the
plot may follow some familiar horror tropes, the execution is skillful enough to
maintain a sense of suspense and tension. However, the characters themselves
feel somewhat one-dimensional, which can make it difficult to fully invest in
their fates. Overall, 'Ghost Light' is a solid choice for fans of atmospheric
horror looking for a spooky read that will keep them turning the pages late into
the night.
