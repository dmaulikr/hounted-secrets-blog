 'Ghost Light' is a spine-tingling tale that effectively combines the
supernatural with the dramatic backdrop of a theater. The author skillfully
builds tension through a series of eerie encounters and unexplained phenomena,
keeping readers on edge throughout the story. The atmospheric setting of the
haunted theater adds a layer of creepiness that enhances the overall sense of
dread. While the plot may follow some familiar horror tropes, the novel's unique
