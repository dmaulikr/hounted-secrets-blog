## Full spoiler-free review
 'Ghost Light' is a chilling tale that combines elements of classic ghost
stories with the dramatic backdrop of a theater setting. The author skillfully
weaves together themes of ambition, betrayal, and the price of fame, creating a
sense of unease that lingers long after the final curtain call. While the plot
may follow some familiar tropes of the horror genre, the haunting atmosphere and
sinister revelations keep readers engaged until the spine-tingling climax.
However, the character development falls somewhat short, with the ensemble cast
feeling somewhat one-dimensional at times. Overall, 'Ghost Light' is a
captivating read for fans of supernatural horror who enjoy a blend of theatrical
intrigue and spectral suspense.
