## Full spoiler-free review
 'Ghost Light' immerses readers in a chilling world where the boundaries between
the supernatural and reality are as thin as gossamer curtains. The author
skillfully weaves together elements of classic ghost stories with the high-
stakes drama of the theater, creating a haunting narrative that lingers long
after the final act. While the pacing may lag at times, the overall atmosphere
of foreboding and mystery keeps the reader engaged. The characters, though not
all equally fleshed out, serve as vessels for exploring themes of ambition,
sacrifice, and the price of artistic success. Fans of both horror and the
performing arts will find much to appreciate in this dark tale of spectral
vengeance and the lingering power of the stage's ghostly past.
